# Welcome to WeaverCore!

WeaverCore is a Hollow Knight modding library designed to allow modders to take full advantage of the Unity Editor to make brand new content for the game, such as new Enemies, Bosses, Scenes, NPCs, and more

If you want to see some examples of where WeaverCore is used, check out the [Inferno King Grimm](https://github.com/nickc01/Inferno-King-Grimm) project, and the [Corrupted Kin](https://github.com/nickc01/Corrupted-Kin)

> [!NOTE]
> This guide assumes you have some knowledge on how to program in C# and how to use the Unity Editor. If you need some guides on how to program in C#, you can look up some tutorials on how to do it ([Like Brackeys](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N775KsWQVkw)). If you are looking for a guide on how to install the Unity Editor, you can look [here](xref:installingUnity.md)

# Installation

First, open up the Unity Hub, and create a new 2D Unity Project:

> [!NOTE]
> WeaverCore requires Unity Editor version 2020.2.2 to work. Make sure you are creating the project under this version

When the project is fully loaded up in the Editor, right click on the "Assets" folder and click on "Show In Explorer" to open it up in the Windows Explorer.

### Downloading WeaverCore

The next step is to download WeaverCore. There are two main ways it can be installed:
**Method 1 : Downloading the Zip**

To download WeaverCore as a zip, go to the [WeaverCore Repository Page](https://github.com/nickc01/WeaverCore) click on the "Code" button and then click on "Download ZIP". This will download the entire WeaverCore project as a zip file.

Once downloaded, extract all the contents into a "WeaverCore" folder in the "Assets" folder of your project. The end result should look like this:
